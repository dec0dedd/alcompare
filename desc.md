## How does it work?

Alcompare compares and visualizes various time series models based on their forecasts on finance data from yfinance python library. Models have access to around ~ 10 years of financial data (stocks' closing price) for a choosen ticker. Then based on that data they try to forecast stock closing price for the next year.

## How should I compare models?

Alcompare provides you with useful visualizations of models' predictions which are way easier to interpret than raw numbers. Besides that, it also calculates various metrics like [MSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error), [MAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error), [R2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination), [MedAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation) to make comparisons more quantitative.
